Because we’re baking falafel here and not frying it, we’re automatically using much less oil than we would in a traditional falafel recipe. But oil is an important ingredient in falafel. It helps it become crisp on the outside while staying moist in the middle. To achieve this delicious balance, you need to drizzle your patties generously with oil. Don’t hold back!",
            "Don’t pack your patties too tightly. It’s tempting to really pack the patties together tightly, but doing so will make them tough and dense. Form the falafel balls gently, and if your mixture isn’t holding together, pulse it a bit more in the food processor until it sticks together. If it’s still too crumbly, pop it in the fridge to chill for 30 minutes before shaping and baking the patties.",

They’ll absorb the tangy, rich flavors of the dressing more deeply, making for an extra-delicious final dish. And speaking of this dressing, it’d be delicious on other roasted veggies too.

        "instructions": [
            "To prepare the tofu: Preheat oven to 400 degrees Fahrenheit and line a rimmed baking sheet with parchment paper. Drain the tofu and use your palms to gently squeeze out some of the water. Slice the tofu into thirds so you have three ½-inch slabs. Transfer the tofu to a plate lined with a lint-free tea towel or paper towels. Fold the towel over one tofu slab, then place the other slab on top, then repeat with the last slab. Top with more towel and place something heavy on top (like a cast iron skillet) to help press the water out of the tofu.",
            "While the tofu drains, make the peanut sauce: Simply whisk together all of the sauce ingredients until well blended. If the flavor seems too bold or the sauce is too thick, thin it with a tablespoon or two of water. Set aside.",
            "To bake the tofu: Transfer the drained tofu to a cutting board. Slice each slab into four columns and four rows. Whisk together 1 tablespoon olive oil and tamari, then drizzle it over the tofu and toss to coat. Sprinkle 1 teaspoon arrowroot starch over the tofu, then toss the tofu until the starch is evenly incorporated. Repeat with 1 more teaspoon arrowroot starch. Arrange the tofu in an even layer on the baking sheet. Bake for 30 to 35 minutes, tossing halfway, until the tofu is crisp and deeply golden.",
            "To make the mango salsa: Combine ingredients in a small serving bowl and toss. Taste, and add additional salt and/or a little splash of white wine vinegar if necessary. Set aside.",
            "To prepare the cabbage/lettuce: Slice off the thick stem and bottom ¼th of the head of cabbage/lettuce. Gently pull off one leaf at a time. Repeat until you have 6 to 8 cabbage leaves.",
            "If you want to go the extra mile with the tofu: Once the tofu has finished baking, toast the coconut flakes and chopped peanuts in a medium skillet over medium heat, stirring frequently, until the coconut is golden on the edges. Add the tofu to the pan. Pour in ⅔rds of the peanut sauce and toss to coat. Cook, stirring frequently, until the tofu has absorbed the sauce and has turned golden on the edges. Transfer to a plate to cool.",
            "To assemble the cabbage wraps: Divide the salsa amongst the salad wraps. Top with tofu and additional peanut sauce. Serve!"

If you’re gluten-free, be sure to seek out certified gluten-free oats, which are processed in wheat-free facilities and tested to make sure that they don’t contain gluten.",

Cook a big batch in advance and portion it into individual containers. In the morning, reheat it on the stove or in the microwave, and gradually add water or milk, as needed, to thin it to your desired consistency. Then, load it up with toppings, and dig in!",
            "Add a dash of salt. Made with just water and oats, oatmeal can be bland. Adding a dash of salt won’t make your cereal salty, but it will bring out the nutty flavor of the oats. To take it over the top, add a drop of maple syrup or honey for a delectable sweet/salty contrast.",

Some recipes call for you to mash the avocado in a separate bowl before piling it onto the bread, but in my opinion, the more texture the avocado has, the better your toast will be (we’re not making guacamole). Halve the avocado and remove the pit. Then, use a paring knife to score cubes of the avocado inside the skin without piercing the skin. Drizzle the diced flesh with lemon juice and sprinkle it with flaky sea salt before scooping and mashing onto the toast. Alternatively, slice the avocado inside the skin, season it, and fan the slices onto the bread. No need to mash!",

Mix on medium-low speed for 5 to 7 minutes, until the dough is well-formed around the hook. If the dough is very dry after 3 minutes, add 1 tablespoon water. (Note: I don't recommend mixing this dough without a stand mixer, it's a stiff dough that gets nice and smooth this way).",

As you work with each piece through the next few steps, keep the dough that you’re not working with covered in plastic wrap.",

Place one hand palm up so that your four fingers are centered on top of the rope. Fold each side of the dough over your fingers, so that the ends overlap by about 2 inches. (see photo above). Holding the dough, turn your hand over and roll your hand on the countertop to seal the two ends together.",
            "Place each finished piece onto a baking sheet. Dust the tops with a very slight amount of flour to keep the plastic wrap from sticking to the dough. Cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate overnight.",

            "Weigh your flour. Because this bagel recipe uses a large amount of flour, you should weigh it if you can. This way, you’ll know exactly how much flour you’re using. Cup measurements are much less precise, as they can vary based on a variety of factors (your specific measuring cups, how tightly you pack your flour, etc.). If you don’t have a kitchen scale, check out this post for my best tips on measuring flour with measuring cups.",
            "Let the dough rise somewhere warm. Yeast responds to warmth, so, for an extra productive rise, stick the dough somewhere warm. We like to put ours on a sunny windowsill!",
            "Keep it covered. To keep the bagel dough moist and pliable, always cover it with plastic wrap when you’re not working with it. Cover all of it during its initial rise and its overnight rise, and cover any dough you’re not working with while you shape the bagels.",
            "Don’t boil the bagels until they float. Before you start boiling the bagels, place one into a small bowl of water to see if it floats. If it does, the bagels are ready to cook! If it doesn’t, let the bagel dough proof for an additional 30 minutes, or until one floats. This test ensures that the dough contains plenty of air – if you cook it too soon, your homemade bagels will be dense."

Stir until the rice is evenly coated with green purée and continue to cook, stirring constantly, for a minute. Add the rest of the vegetable broth to the pot. Bring to a boil, then reduce the heat to a low simmer and cover the pot. Cook the rice on a very low simmer until tender, 35 to 40 minutes.",

Arrange in a single layer on your prepared baking sheet. Bake for 35 to 40 minutes, tossing halfway, until the sweet potatoes are tender and caramelizing at the edges.",

When ready, the skin should be crisp and the inside tender and fluffy. Split and serve immediately with the toppings of your choice."

Add up to another 250ml water, a little at a time, until you have a batter that pours in a constant stream without breaking – the amount of water will vary depending on the consistency of the molasses. If the batter still seems too thick, add a little more water until you get the right consistency. If you add too much water, add more flour until you have the right consistency. Cover the bowl and leave to rest at room temperature for 4-5 hrs or overnight.",
            "Heat a generous amount of oil in a large wok over a high heat (around 200C if using a thermometer). When it's very hot, reduce the heat to medium – this will ensure the oil is hot enough for the handesh to puff up immediately without burning. Pour a little of the batter directly into the centre of the wok with a jug or ladle and wait a few seconds for it to puff up slowly and rise to the surface of the oil. Move it away from the centre of the pan with a spoon and cook for 25-30 seconds on each side until brown all over and cooked inside – you can tear one open to check that it's cooked through. Remove from the wok using a slotted spoon and place on a plate lined with kitchen paper. Repeat with the remaining batter. Enjoy hot with a cup of tea or tear into small pieces and cover in warm milk to eat like cereal."

Saute onions and mushrooms for 7-8 minutes (see notes), until fragrant, then add parsnips, carrots, celery, garlic, thyme, salt and pepper stirring for 1o mins until carrots are al dente and mushrooms give off their liquid. Cook off the liquid.",

Mash with a potato masher and add olive oil, vegan sour cream,  granulated roasted garlic, salt, pepper and optional truffle oil and nutritional yeast.  Add a 1/4 cup- 1/2 cup of the hot potato water to loosen them ( easier to spread).Whip them up until creamy with the masher! Taste and adjust salt and pepper.",
            "Assemble:  Scoop the filling into a greased, large 9×13 inch baking dish, or a large oven-proof cast iron skillet or dutch oven, or smaller individual-sized baking dishes, or ramekins. ***At this point you could divide your stew mixture – adding cooked chicken, lamb or beef to part of it for meat-eaters.

            "The original recipe call for sunchokes– which add great flavor here, but can be hard to find. ( So I subbed white beans) If using sunchokes, wash well, no need to peel, cut into a medium dice and roast with a little olive oil salt and pepper in a 400F oven until a little crispy, first for the BEST flavor. Then add to the stew with the peas."

            "7 Tbsp light (or full-fat) canned coconut milk (well shaken)",
            "1/2 tsp vanilla extract (optional)",
            "1/4 cup unsweetened cocoa or cacao powder, or finely ground hazelnuts (optional // for coating)"
        ],
        "instructions": [
            "Place finely chopped chocolate in a medium-sized mixing bowl. The finer the chocolate is chopped, the easier it will melt and the quicker the truffle-making process will go.",
            "In a separate small mixing bowl, add coconut milk and microwave until very warm but not boiling – about 25 seconds (alternatively, heat in a small saucepan over medium heat until just starting to simmer).",
            "Immediately add coconut milk to chocolate and loosely cover with a cooking lid or towel to trap the heat in. Do not touch for 5 minutes. Then lift cover and use a mixing spoon to gently stir, trying not to incorporate air. Continue stirring until completely melted, creamy, and smooth.",
            "NOTE: If, for some reason, you have unmelted pieces left, you can microwave the mixture in 10-second increments until completely smooth (just be careful not to overcook or it can affect the integrity of the chocolate).",
            "Add vanilla at this time and stir (optional).",
            "Set the mixture in the refrigerator to chill uncovered for 2-3 hours, or until almost completely solid. A good test is dipping a knife into the middle of the bowl to see if any chocolate sticks. If it comes out mostly clean, it’s ready to scoop. If there’s still wet chocolate in the center, continue refrigerating.",
            "Once chilled and firm, prepare a small dish of cocoa or cacao powder for rolling (optional).",
            "Use a Tablespoon-sized scoop (such as this one from Amazon) or a Tablespoon to scoop out small balls (see photo), then use your hands to gently but quickly roll/form the chocolate into balls.",
            "Toss in cocoa or cacao powder to coat and shake off excess (or leave bare), then set on a parchment-lined serving dish. Continue until all chocolate is scooped. There should be about 16 truffles (amount as original recipe is written // adjust if altering batch size), depending on the size of your scoop.",
            "If any of the chocolate near the center of the bowl was too soft to form, refrigerate that portion for a bit longer before proceeding.",
            "Enjoy truffles immediately, or refrigerate for 1-2 hours or overnight. This allows them to set and firm up.",
            "Store truffles covered in the refrigerator for best freshness. To serve, let come to room temperature for 10-15 minutes before serving for optimum creaminess."

One bar weighs 17.6 ounces and I used a little more than half for this recipe, which is approximately 9 ounces, or scant 1 1/4 cup chopped. *Recipe loosely adapted from Oh, Ladycakes. *Nutrition information is a rough estimate."
